 * Non-empty case without break is suspicios
    ::

        switch(foo) {
            case 0:        // <- this is probably ok
            case 1:
                bar();
                break;

            case 2:
                baz();     // <- this is suspicious
            case 3:
                xyzzy();
                break;
            
            case 4:
                baz();
                // nobreak    <- this is clearly intentional
            case 5:
                xyzzy();
                break;
        }

 * Scope reduce
     ::
 
         {
             int i;
             {
                 // i should be declared here
                 i = 0;
             }
         }
 * Empty compound statements
     ::
 
         if (ololo) {
 
         } else {
 
         }
 
 * Star alignment in pointer declarations
 * Newlines and braces
 * Prevent overriding parent's private methods
 * Bool variable used in bitwise &, | or ^
 * Find somewhat useful complexity metric
 * loadView should set self.view or call [super loadView] before reading self.view
 * Ivars inherited from UIView should be released and nulled in viewDidUnload
 * Whitespace around binary operator should be symmetrical
     ::
 
         a * b // OK
         a*b // OK
         a* b // BAD
         a  * b // BAD

* Ivar never read or never written
* Find orphan instance methods (not part of public interface and not called by anyone in implementation part)
* viewDidLoad and viewDidUnload must call super implementation
* variable context size instead of always one line

Other stuff
===========
