What is this?
=============

Code analysis tool for automating some mundane parts of code review process.
It is intented primarily for codebases compilable with clang.


How do I use it?
================

::

    cd my_shiny_project

    # assuming you keep your source files in src directory
    /path/to/trollint/trollint.py src/**/*.cpp

    # again, assuming that your favorite browser is elinks
    elinks report/index.html 


It spits out a stacktrace about libclang.so (or dylib or dll). Wat do?
======================================================================

trollint uses libclang.so, ensure that LD_LIBRARY_PATH or whatever it is on your platform contains path to clang library.

I want moar analyses
====================

    Add some to passes directory.
